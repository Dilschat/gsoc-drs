Public repository for the GSOC DRS project

The Data Repository Service (DRS) API provides a generic interface to data repositories 
so data consumers, including workflow systems, can access data in a single, 
standard way regardless of where it’s stored and how it’s managed. 
The main goal of this project is the generation of a prototype server for DRS API that 
follows the [current draft specification of the DRS](https://github.com/ga4gh/data-repository-service-schemas/tree/develop)
